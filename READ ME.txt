Project: Auction Engine System
Author: Ariolu Joshua


This project shows part of a simple online auction system, which will allow users to bid on items for sale.
Provide a bid tracker interface and concrete implementation with the following functionality:

1. Record a user's bid on an item, each new bid must be at a higher price than before
2. Get the current winning bid for an item
3. Get all the bids for an item
4. Get all the items on which a user has bid


How the program works:
From the list of items provided by the system. Users can select what items to bid.


- First, create client profile that accepts String values (client name & client registration id) as parameters.
 e.g. Client client1 = new Client("Bright", "SE03");



- Next, registers client as a bidder and this accepts client Object as its parameter.
 e.g. Bid bidder1 = new Bid(client1);




-Next stage is for the user to start bidding.
 e.g.  Auction auction1 = new Auction();



-The next step is for the user to place a bid (accepts item number, bid Object and an amount(price) as  parameters)
 e.g.  auction1.placeBid(1,bidder1,2); 
 where 1= item number and 2= amount



-The next step is to get the winning bid for an item (accepts item number as its parameter)
 e.g. auction1.getItemWinningBid(1);
 where 1 is equal to item number.



-The next step is to get all the bids for an item and it accepts item number as its parameters.
 e.g. auction1.getItemBids(1);
 where 1 is equal to item number.


-The next step is to get the current winning bidder for an item and it accepts item number as its parameters.
 e.g. auction1.getItemWinningBidder(1);
 where 1 is equal to item number.

The final step is to get all the items for which a bidder has bid for.
e.g. auction1.getItemsBidFor();
